# memory-utils
A collection of buffer implementations in Java.

> [!WARNING]
> These buffer implementations prioritize performance over safety. Beyond basic memory safety (no overflows and such) nothing else is guaranteed.
> Read & Write offsets and many other things are never validated, incorrect usage can result in a lot of issues that are difficult to identify & debug.
